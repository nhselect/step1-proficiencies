        Who these proficiencies are for
      </h2>

      <p class="nhsuk-body-l">
        These proficiencies are designed for use by registered nurses embarking on a career working in a Level 3 critical care area.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        Critical care nurses play a pivotal role in the assessment, care and recovery of those patients who experience critical illness. Their experience, proficiency and knowledge allow them to work both on their own and in partnership with wider multidisciplinary healthcare teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Critical care nurses use a range of skills, including:
      </p>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Assessing the complex patient </li>
        <li>Interventional application</li>
        <li>Rehabilitation and recovery planning</li>
        <li>Information and knowledge management</li>
        <li>Leadership and risk management</li>
        <li>Decision making</li>
        <li>Communicating</li>
        <li>Influencing and negotiating</li>
        <li>Engagement and facilitation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Nurses are required to provide safe, high quality services for the public, and support improvements in the critical care environment so that the safety and quality of care is continually enhanced.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The critical care environment is a constantly changing field with emerging technologies and therapies to aid patient recovery through the often life-threatening illness. Nurses need to ensure they develop and maintain proficiency in practice to meet the challenges presented.
      </p>

      <h2>
        How you can develop proficiency in critical care
      </h2>

      <p>
        You can use these proficiencies to inform your development. You might already be close to achieving all of these proficiencies, or might be a long way off and have a lot of development to undertake depending on your previous experience.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The thought processes you need to go through and the actions you need to take will be similar, the difference will be in the amount of experience that is needed and the level of knowledge required in supporting further development along the steps of proficiency.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        These proficiencies describe what it is that an individual is expected and able to do when they are fully functioning as a competent safe practitioner.
      </p>
