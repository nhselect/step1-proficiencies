      <p>
        All Step 1 proficiencies have been designed to provide you with the core generic skills required to safely and professionally care for the critically ill patient in a general critical care unit under the supervision and support of your Mentor, Lead Assessor and/or Practice Educator.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 1 proficiencies will form the first part of your development in critical care, and may be included as part of a local Preceptorship programme if you are newly qualified.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What you need to demonstrate
      </h2>

      <p>
        You'll need to be able to demonstrate a fundamental underpinning knowledge in relation to all the proficiency statements outlined. You should keep a record of any supportive evidence and reflective practice to assist you during progress and assessment reviews, and to inform your NMC Revalidation.
      </p>

      <h2>
        When to complete the proficiencies
      </h2>

      <p>
        You should aim to complete Step 1 proficiencies within 12 months of appointment or returning to critical care. However, this timeframe will be agreed locally by your line manager and will be dependent on your previous knowledge and experience, your hours and pattern of work, and local service needs.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Supernumerary period
      </h2>

      <p>
        You'll receive a supernumerary period when joining or returning to the critical care team. This will be agreed locally depending on your circumstances, however all newly registered nurses will need a minimum of 6 weeks. Proficiencies requiring completion within your supernumerary period are marked with a <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--purple">Supernumerary</strong> tag.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Learning contract
      </h2>

      <p>
        On starting your critical care development you'll complete a Learning Contract with your Lead Assessor and Unit Manager. This will provide the foundations for:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your individual commitment to learning
        </li>
        <li>
          Your assessors' commitment to the supervision and support you will require
        </li>
        <li>
          your managers' commitment to providing designated time and opportunities to learn
        </li>
      </ul>
