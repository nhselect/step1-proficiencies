      <p>
        All Step 2 Proficiencies have been designed to provide you with further core critical care skills, building on those already attained in Step 1.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you progress through this section of your development you will be expected to demonstrate your enhanced theoretical knowledge and provide a rationale for your practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will still require the supervision and support of your Mentor, Lead Assessor and/or Practice Educator and you are advised to keep a record of any supportive evidence and reflective practice to assist you during progress and assessment reviews and to inform your NMC Revalidation.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is anticipated that these proficiencies will form the next steps of your development and will be included as part of your post registration academic programme of education, which will be delivered by your local Higher Educational Institute (HEI).
      </p>

      <p>
        During this section you will build on a range of skills including:
      </p>

        <li>Interventional application </li>
        <li>Decision making</li>
        <li>Influencing and negotiating</li>

      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Demonstrate skilled performance in the activity, whilst providing enhanced theoretical knowledge and understanding, giving rationale for your practice</li>
        <li>Demonstrate application of knowledge and understanding in relation to relevant policies, procedures and guidelines</li>
        <li>Participate in problem solving through critical analysis and evaluation of more complex situations</li>
